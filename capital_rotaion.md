i want you to help me plan adding a new features inside this project create a new section for meteora capital rotaion feature the idea is that user create - import their wallet or just add their wallet address to monitor their positions and they can add the chosen tokens address they want to a whitelist and choose  the preferable quote token usdc or sol or both so we can give the best pools from what they choose in terms of fees - volume etc every a period of time  and compare it to their positions and propose the oprtunities that are better than they current positions to rotate capital to and diplay this pools data and they confirm if they want to confirm the rotation. make sure this are seperate from our current code to avoid confusion in terms of file structure
