## 🤔 Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "How do you get the data?"

### Q: "Is this free?"
**A:** "The full analytics dashboard is completely free. We're planning a premium tier for advanced features like 1-minute monitoring and unlimited alerts, but core functionality stays free."

### Q: "What about privacy/security?"
**A:** "We use Fernet encryption for wallet storage. Auth codes are time-limited. We never have access to your private keys unless you explicitly enable Degen Mode."

### Q: "Can I use this on mobile?"
**A:** "Yes! The dashboard is fully responsive. We also send Telegram alerts, so you're always notified on your phone. Native mobile apps are on our roadmap."

### Q: "How do you make money?"
**A:** "We're planning premium tiers and potential API access. But our goal is to keep the core analytics free for the community."

### Q: "Can I integrate this into my platform?"
**A:** "Yes! We're open to partnerships and white-label solutions. Let's chat after this."

### Q: "What's your edge over [competitor]?"
**A:** "Three things: 100% focus on Meteora DLMM (not a generic DEX tool), built-in security analysis, and automated mobile alerts. We're built by DLMM traders, for DLMM traders."
