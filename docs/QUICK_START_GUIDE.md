| **Pair Name** | The two tokens in the pool (e.g., SOL/USDC) |

---

## Step 3: Use Filters

### Finding Pools That Match Your Criteria

Located at the top of the dashboard, filters help you narrow down 4,000+ pools to what matters to you.

### Common Filter Examples:

**Example 1: Find High-APR Opportunities**
1. Find "Minimum APR" field
2. Enter: `50`
3. Click "Apply" or press Enter
4. Now you only see pools with APR > 50%

**Example 2: Find Large, Liquid Pools**
1. Set "Minimum TVL": `50000` (for $50k+)
2. Set "Minimum Volume 24h": `10000` (for $10k+)
3. Apply filters
4. Safer, more established pools appear

**Example 3: Find Trending Small Caps**
1. Set "Maximum TVL": `10000` (under $10k)
2. Set "Minimum 30m Fee Rate": `5`
3. Apply filters
4. Discover early-stage opportunities

### Available Filters:

- **Search** - Find pools by name or token address
- **Minimum 30m Fees** - Filter by 30-minute fee earnings
- **Minimum Volume 24h** - Filter by trading volume
- **Minimum TVL** - Filter by total liquidity
- **Minimum APR** - Filter by annual returns
- **Hide Blacklisted** - Remove flagged pools (recommended)

### Tips:
- Start with broad filters, then narrow down
- Combine multiple filters for precise results
- Save your favorite filter combinations for later
- Clear filters to see all pools again

## Step 4: Analyze a Pool

### Deep Dive Into Pool Details

Once you've found an interesting pool, click anywhere on its row to expand detailed information.

### What You'll See:

**📊 Left Column: Overview**
- Pool metadata (address, age, fees)
- Current prices for both tokens
- Transaction statistics
- Liquidity distribution

**🛡️ Middle Column: Security**
- **RugCheck Report** - Automated vulnerability scan
  - Green: Low risk
  - Yellow: Medium risk
  - Red: High risk
- **Token Holders** - Top holders and concentration
- **Authority Status** - Mint/freeze authority info

**📈 Right Column: Market Data**
- Volume across timeframes (5m, 1h, 6h, 24h)
- Price changes by period
- Buy/sell distribution
- Historical trends

### Key Checks Before Trading:

1. **Security Score** - Look for green indicators
2. **Holder Concentration** - Avoid if one holder has >20%
3. **Authority Status** - Better if mint authority is null/renounced
4. **Liquidity Depth** - Higher TVL = less slippage
5. **Volume Trends** - Consistent volume is healthier than spikes

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- ⚠️ High risk on RugCheck
- ⚠️ Single holder with >20% of supply
- ⚠️ Pool is blacklisted
- ⚠️ Mint/freeze authority not renounced
- ⚠️ Very low TVL (<$1000)
- ⚠️ No trading volume
