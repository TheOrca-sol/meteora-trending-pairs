# Phase 2 Performance Analysis: /pair/groups Migration

## Summary

**Decision: Stick with Phase 1 (Client-side filtering with /pair/all)**

Phase 2 implementation using `/pair/groups` API was **not viable** due to severe performance issues. The two-level caching approach is **30-45 minutes slower** than the simple client-side filtering approach.

## Background

After implementing Phase 1 (client-side filtering), we attempted Phase 2 migration to the `/pair/groups` API for:
1. Better scalability (server-side filtering)
2. Reduced bandwidth (only fetch active groups)
3. Granular caching (separate TTLs for groups and pools)

However, testing revealed critical performance issues.

## Performance Comparison

### Phase 1: Client-Side Filtering (WINNER ‚úÖ)

**Implementation:**
- Single API call to `/pair/all`
- Returns all 116,604 pools in one response
- Client-side filtering (hide, blacklist, min TVL)

**Performance:**
```
Total time:        12.4 seconds
API fetch:         ~10 seconds
Client filtering:  ~2 seconds
Final pools:       4,370 pools
Data reduction:    96.2% (112,234 filtered out)
```

**Cache Statistics:**
```json
{
  "total_pools_raw": 116604,
  "total_pools_filtered": 4370,
  "pools_filtered_out": 112234,
  "hidden_filtered": 101,
  "blacklisted_filtered": 103,
  "low_tvl_filtered": 112030,
  "last_fetch_duration": 12.402429
}
```

### Phase 2: Two-Level Caching (FAILED ‚ùå)

**Implementation:**
- Level 1: Fetch all groups from `/pair/groups` (with pagination)
- Level 2: Lazy-load pools for each group from `/pair/groups/{id}`

**Performance:**
```
Total pages:       5,469 pages (100 items/page)
Total groups:      54,690 groups
Fetch rate:        ~2-3 pages/second
Estimated time:    30-45 MINUTES (!!!)
Status:            UNACCEPTABLE - test aborted
```

**Problem:**
The `/pair/groups` endpoint returns **54,690 groups** (not the expected ~1,000), requiring pagination through 5,469 pages. At ~2-3 pages/second, the initial fetch would take 30-45 minutes, making it completely impractical for production use.

**Test Output:**
```
INFO:grouped_pool_cache:Groups cache MISS - Fetching from /pair/groups...
INFO:grouped_pool_cache:Fetched groups page 2/5469...
INFO:grouped_pool_cache:Fetched groups page 3/5469...
...
INFO:grouped_pool_cache:Fetched groups page 25/5469...
[Test aborted - too slow]
```

## Why Phase 2 Failed

### Issue 1: Unexpected API Data Volume
- **Assumption:** `/pair/groups` would return ~1,000 active groups
- **Reality:** 54,690 groups across 5,469 paginated pages
- **Impact:** Initial cache population takes 30-45 minutes

### Issue 2: Pagination Overhead
- Each page request has network latency (~300-500ms)
- 5,469 requests √ó 500ms = ~45 minutes
- Cannot parallelize (would hit rate limits)

### Issue 3: No Server-Side Filtering
- The `/pair/groups` endpoint doesn't support query parameters to filter groups
- Must fetch ALL groups before filtering client-side
- Defeats the purpose of using this endpoint

### Issue 4: Cache Cold-Start Problem
- Every server restart = 30-45 minute warmup
- Every cache expiry (1 hour TTL) = 30-45 minute refresh
- Unacceptable for production use

---

## Final Recommendation

**Use Phase 1 (Client-Side Filtering with /pair/all)**

### Reasons:
1. **Performance:** 12.4 seconds vs 30-45 minutes (150x faster!)
2. **Simplicity:** Single API call, no pagination complexity
3. **Reliability:** Proven to work in production
4. **Effective Filtering:** Still removes 96.2% of trash pools
5. **Fast Cache Refresh:** 12 seconds every 5 minutes is acceptable

### Implementation Status:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 implemented in `backend/pool_cache.py`
- ‚úÖ Filtering removes 112,234 trash pools (96.2% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Configurable filters (hide, blacklist, min TVL)
- ‚úÖ Fast cache refresh (12.4s)
- ‚úÖ Production-ready

### Phase 2 Implementation:
- ‚úÖ Implemented in `backend/grouped_pool_cache.py` (for reference)
- ‚ùå **NOT recommended for production use**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Can be enabled via `USE_GROUPED_CACHE=true` (default: false)
- üìù Kept in codebase for documentation purposes

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Limit Pagination
**Idea:** Only fetch first N pages (e.g., 100 pages = 10,000 groups)

**Pros:**
- Faster (100 pages √ó 500ms = ~50 seconds)
- Still covers most active groups

**Cons:**
- Arbitrary limit - might miss important groups
- Still slower than Phase 1 (50s vs 12s)
- Requires tuning and monitoring

**Verdict:** Not worth the complexity

---

### Option B: Background Pre-Warming
**Idea:** Pre-fetch all groups in background thread on startup

**Pros:**
- First user request wouldn't wait 45 minutes
- Cache would be ready after warmup

**Cons:**
- 30-45 minute server startup delay
- High memory usage (54,690 groups)
- Still slow on cache expiry
- Complexity for marginal benefit

**Verdict:** Not worth the complexity

---

### Option C: Use Different Endpoint
**Idea:** Find alternative Meteora API endpoints

**Investigation:**
We tested all available endpoints:
- `/pair/all` - ‚úÖ Works great (Phase 1)
- `/pair/all_by_groups_2` - Similar pagination issues
- `/pair/all_by_groups_metadata` - Similar pagination issues
- `/pair/all_with_pagination` - Still returns all pools, just paginated
- `/pair/groups` - ‚ùå Performance issues (Phase 2)

**Verdict:** `/pair/all` is the best option

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test Before Committing:** Always test performance with real data
2. **Measure Don't Assume:** Our assumption about group count was wrong (1K vs 55K)
3. **Simple is Better:** Client-side filtering is simpler AND faster
4. **Deprecated ‚â† Slow:** Sometimes "deprecated" APIs perform better
5. **Pagination Overhead:** Network latency compounds with high page counts

---

## Conclusion

The `/pair/all` endpoint with client-side filtering (Phase 1) is the **optimal solution** for this use case:

- ‚úÖ **12.4 seconds** fetch time (vs 30-45 minutes)
- ‚úÖ **96.2% data reduction** (112,234 pools filtered)
- ‚úÖ **Simple implementation** (no complex caching)
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** (currently deployed)
- ‚úÖ **Effective** (only 4,370 quality pools remain)

**Recommendation:** Continue using Phase 1 indefinitely, even though `/pair/all` is marked as deprecated by Meteora. The alternative APIs are not performant enough for our use case.
